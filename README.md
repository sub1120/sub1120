- 👋 Hi, I’m @sub1120 
- 👀 I am person with keen interest in Application Development and making them live into production. I worked on technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Express.js. I am good at reading and writing documentation. I have good analytical thinking to solve a particular problem effectively at low cost.
- 🌱 I am Site Reliability Engineer at TCS. Though my current role, I worked closely with developers and understood the whole software development life cycle from converting the client requirement into code and going through various stages of testing (QA, Beta, Canary) and finally deploying it to production and this cycle continues. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Full Stack Projects and open for Web Developer Roles.
